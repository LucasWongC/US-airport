Hi Lucas

I hope you're doing great today.

I'm happy to tell you that you are going to the next step with the FrontEnd Developer.

As per the client's request, below please find the details for the technical exercise you should solve. Please remember to let me know when you send it just for me to know and keep a track of it.

EXERCISE
Build a web app using React and deploy it on www.netlify.com, using their free package.
This app should calculate the distance between two US airports in nautical miles, using auto-complete for the airport fields. Airports should be searchable by name or 3-digit code.
Bonus: plot the route on Google maps.
Note: Please choose the API you think best fits your solution.

Once completed, please send us the Netlify URL of the app and a zip of the source code.

You will be evaluated based on:

- The structure of your React components, HTML, and CSS structure
- Use of Material UI components
- The cleanliness (or whatever else you care about) of your visual design
- Appropriate use of TypeScript

Please confirm that you received this email.

Let me know if you have any inconvenience.

Hope to hear from you soon!

Regards,

Catherine Nino M.
